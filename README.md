**Total timeline: 6 weeks**

**Budget:**
Assuming that a typical developer's hourly rate is $50, and each developer works 40 hours per week, the estimated budget for this project would be:

6 weeks * 40 hours/week * $50/hour = $12,000 per developer

The actual budget may vary depending on the number of developers involved, their respective hourly rates, and the total number of hours worked.

**Resources needed:**

1. A team of developers experienced in Django and related technologies (Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
2. A project manager to coordinate the development process and ensure timely delivery
3. A designer to create the user interface and user experience for the application
4. A QA engineer to perform testing and ensure the quality of the code and functionalities
5. A DevOps engineer for deployment and ongoing maintenance of the application

Please keep in mind that this is a high-level plan, and the actual development process may require adjustments based on your specific requirements and the progress of the project.
